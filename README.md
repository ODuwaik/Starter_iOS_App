This modern, production-ready iOS app template is built with SwiftUI and Firebase, featuring a comprehensive authentication system, sleek onboarding flow, and multilingual support. It's like having a personal iOS development assistant who's already done the boring stuff for you! 🧙‍♂️

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Xcode 14.0+
- iOS 15.0+ target deployment
- Swift 5.5+
- CocoaPods (for Firebase dependencies)
- A Firebase project

### 🔥 Quick Start in 5 Easy Steps

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
# Get this awesome code on your machine
git clone https://github.com/ODuwaik/Starter_iOS_App.git
cd Starter_iOS_App
```

#### Step 2: Firebase Magic ✨
1. Head over to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) (it's free!)
2. Create a new project (give it a cool name)
3. Add an iOS app to your Firebase project
   - Use the bundle identifier from the Xcode project (or make up your own!)
   - Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file (treat it like gold!)
4. Drop that precious `GoogleService-Info.plist` file into the `StarterApp` directory

#### Step 3: Dependencies (the good kind)
```bash
# Let CocoaPods do its thing
pod install
```

#### Step 4: Apple Sign In (Optional but fancy)
1. In your Apple Developer account, enable the Sign In with Apple capability
2. Update your Xcode project with the appropriate provisioning profiles
3. Configure Sign In with Apple in Firebase Authentication

#### Step 5: Launch! 🚀
Open the `.xcworkspace` file (not the `.xcodeproj` - that's a rookie mistake!) and hit that ▶️ button in Xcode!

## Customization

### Changing the App Name

### Modifying the Onboarding Flow
1. Edit the `OnboardingViewModel.swift` to add or remove onboarding pages
2. Customize the UI in `OnboardingContainerView.swift`

### Adding New Features
Follow the MVVM pattern used throughout the app:
1. Create a new directory in the Features folder
2. Add ViewModels and Views subdirectories
3. Implement your feature following the established patterns
